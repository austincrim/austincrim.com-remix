{"content":"CSS transitions are easy to use and add that final touch of polish to a UI. I love transitions and they make a site look more professional when used correctly. They were a little confusing at first for me, so I decided to whip up a quick CodePen showing how transitions are written.\n\nTransitions are used to smoothly transition from one style to another. Here's an example using a button with hover and active states.\n\nSee the Pen [CSS Transition Example](https://codepen.io/austincrim/pen/rNxYMxa) by austincrim ([@austincrim](https://codepen.io/austincrim)) on [CodePen](https://codepen.io).\n\nThanks for reading!\n"}
